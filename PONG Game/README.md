# Pong Game

A classic Pong game implementation using Python's Turtle graphics library.

## Description

This project is a recreation of the iconic Pong game. It features two paddles controlled by players and a ball that bounces between them. The game keeps track of the score for both players.

## Files

- `main.py`: The main game loop and setup
- `paddle.py`: Defines the Paddle class for player controls
- `ball.py`: Implements the Ball class with movement and collision logic
- `score.py`: Manages the ScoreBoard class for keeping and displaying scores

## How to Play

1. Run `main.py` to start the game.
2. Player 1 (left paddle) uses 'W' and 'S' keys to move up and down.
3. Player 2 (right paddle) uses the Up and Down arrow keys.
4. The ball will start moving automatically.
5. Try to hit the ball with your paddle to send it back to your opponent.
6. If a player misses the ball, their opponent scores a point.
7. The game continues indefinitely - play as long as you like!
