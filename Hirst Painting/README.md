# Hirst Dot Painting Generator

A Python program that generates artwork inspired by Damien Hirst's famous spot paintings using the Turtle graphics library.

## Description

This project consists of two main components:
1. A color extractor (`Color_extract.py`) that pulls colors from an image.
2. A painting generator (`Painting.py`) that creates a dot painting using the extracted colors.

The result is a 10x10 grid of colorful dots, reminiscent of Damien Hirst's spot paintings.

## Features

- Extract colors from an image using the colorgram library
- Generate a 10x10 grid of colored dots
- Randomized color selection for each dot
- Customizable dot size and spacing
